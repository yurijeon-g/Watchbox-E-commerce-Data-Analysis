# WatchBox Ecommerce Data Analysis (Python & Tableau)
This project analyzes the popular second hand watch ecommerce products of WatchBox. The project involved data scraping, data cleaning, data manipulation and data manipulation. Tools that were used from the end to end of this project were Python and Tableau.

## Aim
Since COVID, the second hand watch industry has grown at an incredible pace with some declaring watches to now be an asset class of its own. 
The aim of this project was to explore the drivers and popular features that contribute to popular watch brands and lines as well as explore preferences in watches between genders.

## About the Process: 
These were the steps taken throughout the project: 

**Data Scraping/Collection:** Using Python, I created a script that would scrape all the product listings and product details of the watches available in Watchbox's Singapore ecommerce page. The data was scraped with selenium and parsed with BeautifulSoup.

**Data Cleaning Scraped Data:** The scraped data had many inconsistencies thus was cleaned using mainly pandas library in Python.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** To get a better idea of the data and identify certain areas and trends to explore deeper into, a simple process of EDA was performed on the cleaned ecommerce product listing data. Features that were mainly explored were
- Brands
- Pricing Distribution
- Movements 
- Manufactured Years Distribution

**Visualization:** Tableau was used to visualize the data.
